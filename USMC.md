# The United States Marine Corps

I enlisted into the Marine Corps in 2008 where i went to boot camp at MCRD San Diego, CA. During my four year enlistment, i travelled all over the world and had life altering experiences, both good and bad. Here are a few things i did professionally...


- Produced approximately 300 high-value target packages while assigned to the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, Japan, and the Korean Combined Operations Intelligence Center in Osan, South Korea.
- Created multiple kinetic and non-kinetic targeting briefings in support of multinational training exercises in Australia, South Korea, Japan, and Thailand.
- Participated on a synchronization team which analyzed the adversaryâ€™s surface-to-air missile capabilities and associated radar stations in the PACOM AOR to identify critical threats to the United States.
- Evaluated approximately 50 analytical assessments on offensive air support, anti-air warfare, electronic warfare, and air reconnaissance operations relating to EA-6B Prowler and AV-8B Harrier aircraft operations in the Marine Aircraft Group-14 (MAG-14).
- Supervised many Marines who were responsible for initiating and processing over 80 security clearance investigations for personnel assigned to MAG-14.
