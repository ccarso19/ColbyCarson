## About Me

Several years ago, I made a career change from the intelligence community to an information technology professional. Being an analyst has helped me develop analytical skills become an effective communicator and collaborator. I'm a father of several beautiful [children](https://github.com/ccarso19/ColbyCarson/blob/6b82bd95c52b36339bfe7179a21a253719401ccd/MyKids), a Marine Corps [veteran](https://github.com/ccarso19/ColbyCarson/blob/6b82bd95c52b36339bfe7179a21a253719401ccd/USMC), a Board Member for a small [nonprofit](https://github.com/ccarso19/ColbyCarson/blob/a6185fe667db2942eca2e3fe8eda67deda4fd441/VOG), a student pursuing my [Bachelor's Degree](Education.md), and actively growing in the realm of technology. I believe nearly any situation can become an opportunity to expand my knowledge and hone my rational-thinking skills. I am ambitious and goal-oriented and dedicate myself to mastering a subject and gaining relevant skills. I am skeptical by nature but open to changing my opinions when the facts prove them wrong. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, I base my conclusions on research and analysis.
